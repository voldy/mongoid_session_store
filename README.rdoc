== Installation
This gem supports rails 3, rails 3.1 and mongoid 2.0

== Setup

In your Gemfile:

  gem "mongoid", "~> 3"
  gem "mongoid_session_store"

In the session_store initializer (config/initializers/session_store.rb) you can comment out every line as
mongoid session store will be setup for use when added to the gemfile. 

If you want to be more explicit you can comment the currently setup store and add: 
 
  Example::Application.config.session_store :mongoid_store
  
== Rake Tasks
Mongoid Session Store comes with a rake task to clear out the sessions it stores in mongoDB

  rake db:mongoid:sessions:clear 
  
== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
